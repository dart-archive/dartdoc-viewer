==========

The front-end Dart documentation viewer.

Here is how our tests are doing:
[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc-viewer/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc-viewer/latest)

### Generating Files & Uploading to Cloud Storage

The viewer uses YAML or JSON files generated by the docgen package at 
pkg/docgen/ in the Dart repository as the data being displayed. These files 
are stored in Google Cloud Storage.

Run `python upload_docgen.py` from `pkg/docgen/bin` in the Dart repository to 
generate these files and upload them to Cloud Storage as a new version.

These tasks can be done separately if necessary:

##### Generating YAML/JSON Files

YAML or JSON files can be generated using the docgen package in the Dart 
repository. See the docgen documentation for more information on how to parse 
specific files and the Dart SDK.

##### Uploading to Cloud Storage

To push new files to Google Cloud Storage for use by the viewer, use the 
`gsutil` tool located at `third_party/gsutil/gsutil` in the Dart repository.

 - Run `python gsutil -m cp -q -a public-read -r <folder> gs://dartlang-docgen`
 to upload the specified folder to the viewer's bucket. Be sure to also upload
 a new VERSION file if the uploaded folder is to be used.**

**Note that the bucket contains several numbered folders for each version of 
the documentation. Run `python gsutil ls gs://dartlang-docgen` to see the
file layout. Follow this convention and update a new VERSION file when
uploading a new version of documentation. You can see the format of the VERSION
file by running `python gsutil cat gs://dartlang-docgen/VERSION`.

### Running Locally

There are two ways to run the viewer locally:

 1. The `dartdoc.py` script in the `pkg/docgen/bin` directory of the Dart
 repository is a useful tool for generating documentation and running the 
 viewer. Checkout the docgen README for more information on how to run it.
 The script makes use of the [Google App Engine SDK for Python][GAE]'s
 development server. This can be used manually without the script by running
 `dev_appserver.py <folder containing app.yaml>`, but first act on the 
 following:
   - When running the viewer on the development server, YAML or JSON files 
   are retrieved from the client/local folder instead of the client/docs folder.
   You must manually rename your 'docs' directory to 'local' for the server to 
   correctly retrieve your files.
   - If you intend to view documentation in a browser other than Dartium, you 
   will first have to compile the viewer to JavaScript. This can be done by 
   running `sdk/bin/dart2js` from the Dart repository on `client/web/app.dart`.
 2. In the Dart Editor, the viewer can be run by running 
 `dart client/build.dart` and then running `index.html` from the 
 `client/web/out/` folder. Be sure to have a working version of YAML 
  or JSON documentation from [Generating YAML Files](#generation). These files 
 should be put in a folder named 'docs' located in the client/ folder.
   

### Pushing to App Engine

Follow these steps to push to Google App Engine:

1. Download the [Google App Engine SDK for Python][GAE] and add it to your 
PATH.

2. Run `appcfg.py update <folder containing app.yaml>`.
